RENDERING TEST SUMMARY
=====================

Cell State Comparisons:
  after_first_move: 0 non-empty cells
  after_second_move: 0 non-empty cells
  after_third_move: 42 non-empty cells
  first_move_after_new_game: 42 non-empty cells

Recommendations:
1. Ensure force_update_all_cells is called after starting a new game
2. Consider using stronger visual refresh techniques in the cell updates
3. Check that the game board container is properly cleared before rebuilding
