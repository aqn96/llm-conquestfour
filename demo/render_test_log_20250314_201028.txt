RENDERING TEST SUMMARY
=====================

Cell State Comparisons:
  after_first_move: 42 non-empty cells
  after_second_move: 42 non-empty cells
  after_third_move: 42 non-empty cells
  first_move_after_title: 42 non-empty cells

Recommendations:
1. Ensure force_update_all_cells is called when returning from title screen
2. Consider using stronger visual refresh techniques in the cell updates
3. Check that the game board container is properly cleared before rebuilding
